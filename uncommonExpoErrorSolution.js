Debugging this type of error requires a systematic approach. There's no single solution since the error is vague and context-dependent. Here's a strategy:

1. **Reproduce with Minimal Code:** Try to replicate the error in the smallest possible codebase. This helps identify the problematic component or library.  A clean project with just the problematic code is beneficial.

2. **Examine the Expo and React Native Versions:** Make sure your Expo CLI, React Native, and other dependencies are compatible. Check the release notes and documentation to identify potential issues.

3. **Check Package.json for Conflicts:** Ensure you have no conflicting packages (different versions of the same library) that may clash.

4. **Console Logging:** Add `console.log` statements throughout your code to monitor the flow of execution and identify where the problem might occur.  Pay attention to unexpected values or missing data.

5. **Examine the Expo Go Output:** If using Expo Go, carefully examine the output messages for any hints or warnings, even if they appear unrelated.

6. **Clean and Rebuild:** Try running `expo prebuild --clean` to clean the build cache and rebuild your project.  Then restart with `expo start --clear`.

7. **Community Support:**  Search Expo forums and community resources for similar reported problems; solutions posted there might help.
